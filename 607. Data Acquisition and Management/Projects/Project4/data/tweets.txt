HillaryClinton	"We have two names to add to a long list of African Americans killed by police officers. It’s unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable."
HillaryClinton	We've also seen the targeting of police officers—but so many serve every day with courage and honor and are committed to reform.
HillaryClinton	"We need to come together to turn the tide, stop violence, build trust, and give all our kids the chance to grow up safe and healthy."
HillaryClinton	"In America, every person, no matter what you look like or who you are, should have the chance to go as far as your dreams will take you."
HillaryClinton	"When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our future."
HillaryClinton	"Building an inclusive economy is another reason we’ve got to break down systemic racism, including under-investment in communities of color."

realDonaldTrump	Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!
realDonaldTrump	Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
realDonaldTrump	Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.
realDonaldTrump	I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!

realDonaldTrump	Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
realDonaldTrump	Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
realDonaldTrump	Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.

realDonaldTrump	"Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!"
realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!

realDonaldTrump	Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
