#############################
>> Week 4 (Feb 19 - Feb 26)

Weekly materials
This week, our formal readings from the book will be a little lighter than some of the practical resources we will look at. The focus is to develop a solid understanding of KNN and Naive Bayes as far as conducting the analysis is concerned. We will be a little light on the theoretical readings. 

Tasks: 

1. Discussion board

2. HW# 2 is assigned

3. Reading and learning materials: 

- KNN R resources: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-nn-classifier-in-r-programming/

- A practical guide on KNN https://www.listendata.com/2017/12/k-nearest-neighbor-step-by-step-tutorial.html

- Naïve Bayes Classifier R resource. https://uc-r.github.io/naive_bayes

- In order to have a good grasp of LDA, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression in terms of how they all compare and contrast, this is a good set of lecture slides: https://mdav.ece.gatech.edu/ece-6254-spring2017/notes/05-logistic-regression.pdf 

- Though it is a bit less academic, I like this video in terms of how clearly it explains the Naive Bayes ideas. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2L2Uv9pdDA

- From the same producer, the Gaussian Naive Bayes: https://youtu.be/H3EjCKtlVog

- ESL: Chapter section 6.6, focus on Naïve Bayes Classifier (6.6.3)

- ESL: Section 7.10 (Cross validation). This may be helpful for HW#3 when you look at the KNN problem. This is an important topic and we will revisit this topic a couple of times.

- ISLR: Chapter 6 (optional). You probably know most of these in terms of variable selection. However, reading the section 6.2 will help the understanding of bias-variance tradeoff, the shrinkage/regularization methods, and variable selection.

- (Optional) Discriminative and generative classifiers: how Logistic Regression differs from Naive Bayes https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2001/file/7b7a53e239400a13bd6be6c91c4f6c4e-Paper.pdf

>> Week 7 (Mar 12 - Mar 19)

Boosting some more!
This week, we dig into boosting and additive models even more. Next week, we will be looking at Support Vector Machine. 

Discussion Board # 7
Homework # 2 due on March 19
Homework # 3 will be posted
Reading: ESL: Chapter 10 (Boosting and Additive Trees)
Helpful lectures :
Not a formal academic source,  but I think these are helpful: AdaBoost explanation: I like the clarity behind this  video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsK-xG1cLYA
Gradient Boosting:
Part 1 (for regression; continuous outcome);
Part 2 (more theoretical);
Part 3 (more practical, classification problem; might be helpful for homework # 3);
Part 4 (more theoretical).
Quite long, especially if you go through all three lecture videos. But if you have the time, very much worth it. http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2018fa/lectures/lecturenote19.html

#############################
>> Week 8 (Mar 19 - Mar 26)
